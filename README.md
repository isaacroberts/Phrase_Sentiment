# Phrase_Sentiment
An implementation of the Movie Sentiment Reviews challenge on Kaggle

Uses various types of data on linguistics phonemes (vowels and consonants) in a sequential manner to determine the sentiment value of words and phrases. Relies on a kaggle database with movie reviews rated by sentiment in a tree like fashion.  

The purpose of this project was to learn how to do sentiment analysis so that it could be applied to the Two Sigma stock trading challenge (worth over $100,000)
